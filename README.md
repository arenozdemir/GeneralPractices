# Procedural works
 There are works from different fields in this repository. It will be constantly updated and new studies will be added.  Some of the mini projects that are currently available: -simple graph -simple procedural mesh generation
 
 Week 1: 
 - I created some shapes by using cubes as graph. These shapes are not based on mesh generation yet but this gonna change :)
 - I worked with custom shader to set cubes color relalted with their positions. You can reach that shader via: Assets/GraphScene/Point/PointURP
 - On BasicProceduralMeshGeneration file, you can find my basic mesh generation
